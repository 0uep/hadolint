A smart Dockerfile linter with 57 rules which help you build
[best practice Docker images](https://docs.docker.com/engine/articles/dockerfile_best-practices/).

The linter is written in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and [transpiled](http://haste-lang.org/) to JavaScript.
It can either be installed as static binary or you can copy paste
your Dockerfile into the code editor.
